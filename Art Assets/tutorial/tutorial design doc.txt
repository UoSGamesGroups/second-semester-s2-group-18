This elements should be placed onto the level, perhaps on a different layer, so
it informs the player of what to do

there are separate elements for:

player 1 movement
player 1 boost
these should be placed with player 1

player 2 movement
player 2 boost
these should be placed with player 2

the transparency has been lowered, so the player can see their character through
this. The text is aiming to be non-invasive

and the last element, the win condition, should be placed in the middle of the
level, so the players can see it when they collide for the first time
