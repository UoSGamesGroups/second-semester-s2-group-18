Power ups:

Increase Speed:
Gives the player a boost in movement speed, that lasts for 5-10 seconds. Playtesting will help to justify the final
duration time. Possibly can be stacked with another speed boost, this would make the players speed increase by 4
times for example, rather than 2 times.

Anchor:
Locks the player in place. This stops them from being pushed or moved and stops them from moving too. This may
need some adjustment, after playtesting. Duration should be between 2-6 seconds and will need to be decided after
playtesting.

Shield:
Allows the player to deflect collision/s. Can either last for an amount of time, 3-7 seconds, or for a certain
amount of hits, between 1-3. This should be decided after playtesting.

Force Push:
Allows the player to push the opponent away, without being too close. This distance, the push distance and when
to use will need to be decided after playtesting.

Increase Mass:
This increases the players mass, making them harder to push. This may also make the player move slower and duration
should be between 2-8 seconds. This can be decided during playtesting.
